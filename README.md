# Sugarcane dataviz
This is a data visualization project about sugarcane and sugar production in the world, using data from [FAOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home). It was inspired by the table [Our Cultivated Planet, created by Benjamin Nowak (@BjnNowak)](https://github.com/BjnNowak/CultivatedPlanet). <br>
This report contains information about the cultivation of sugarcane, a crop that is very important to the Brazilian economy, and that was part of many of my research projects. It also includes one visualization about the trade of sugar, which comes both from sugarcane and sugar beet. <br>
The R codes, data used, and the final images are available in this repository. 

# Sugarcane production
![Sugarcane production](https://github.com/afs77/sugarcane_dataviz/blob/main/final_visualizations/sugarcane_final.jpg?raw=true)
The code is in the sugarcane.R file, [here in the code folder](https://github.com/afs77/sugarcane_dataviz/tree/main/code) <br>
A version of this code for the same visualization but in portuguese is also available in the file canadeacucar_portugues.R, in the code folder. The final image in portuguese is the file canadeacucar_pt.pdf in the folder final_visualizations. 

# Sugar trade

The code is in the sugartrade.R file, [here in the code folder](https://github.com/afs77/sugarcane_dataviz/tree/main/code)
